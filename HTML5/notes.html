    <p>Q: What does ARIA stand for? What is its purpose? A: ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. It's
      a set
      of attributes you can add to HTML elements to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with
      disabilities, especially when using assistive technologies like screen readers. ARIA helps define roles, states,
      and
      properties for UI elements that aren't natively conveyed by standard HTML. (role, aria-hidden, aria-required,
      aria-expanded.)</p>
